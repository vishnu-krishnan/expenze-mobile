Problem
The application lacked personalization for users who prefer dark aesthetics or work in low-light environments. Additionally, while the app tracked expenses, it lacked general-purpose tools for tracking financial thoughts, planned purchases, or bill reminders that don't fit into the structured "Regular Payments" or "Expenses" categories.

Objective
Improve user engagement and accessibility by implementing a premium system-wide dark mode and adding a "Utility" section containing a versatile Notes and Reminders system.

Feature summary
- Adaptive Theming: Complete dark mode support across all screens with fluid transitions.
- Background Enhancements: Gradient patterns that adapt to the active theme for a premium look.
- Utility Suite: A new dedicated section in the application for:
    - Quick Notes: Capturing financial thoughts or future purchase ideas.
    - Reminders: Time-based alerts for important financial tasks.
    - Pinning: Prioritizing critical information at the top.
- Dashboard Optimization: Refined quick actions and cleaner category overviews.

High-level workflow
1. User toggles Dark Mode in the Profile/Appearance settings.
2. Application state (ThemeProvider) updates and persists the choice to shared_preferences.
3. User navigates to the "Notes" tab to create/update or delete utilities.
4. Alerts are set for specific dates/times and displayed prominently.

Business value
- Accessibility: Reduces eye strain and improves usability in dark environments.
- Feature Parity: Brings the app's utility set in line with top-tier financial management products.
- Retention: Encourages daily app usage for tasks beyond simple expense logging.

Risks
- Persistence overhead: Managed via efficient SQLite storage.
- UI Consistency: Addressed by using a centralized theme provider and standard background decorations.

Cost implications
- Minor increase in storage for the additional notes table.
- Negligible compute impact.

Timeline
