Business Overview - Bill Status & Quick Actions
________________________________________________________________________________

Problem
Tracking recurring bills without knowing their current status (e.g., pending, paid, overdue) leads to financial confusion. Additionally, navigating multiple screens to add a simple expense creates friction in daily usage.

Objective
Provide users with more granular control over recurring payments and a streamlined way to record expenses directly from the home screen.

Feature Summary
1.  Bill Status Tracking: Allows users to set a status (e.g., "Paid", "Awaiting Salary") and a description for each regular payment.
2.  Quick Expense Action: A floating button on the dashboard to immediately record expenses without depth-navigation.
3.  Theme Visibility: Full readability in light and dark modes across all core financial screens.

High-level Workflow
-   Users navigate to Regular Payments and tap a bill to edit its status/details.
-   Users tap the "+" button on the Dashboard to open a quick-entry modal for expenses.

Business Value
-   Improved user retention through simplified UX (Quick Actions).
-   Enhanced financial clarity for recurring commitments.
-   Professional, modern aesthetic that builds user trust.

Risks
-   Increased UI complexity if status fields are overused.

Cost Implications
-   Minimal; local database storage only.
