# Business Overview - UI Polish & UX Optimization

Problem
The Expenze app felt technically functional but lacked personality, visual fluidity, and professional copy. Critical paths like profile updates also contained bugs that hindered user trust.

Objective
Enhance the user experience by injecting a friendly yet professional tone, adding smooth animations, and fixing functional bugs in user management.

Feature Summary
1. Engaging Copy: Updated all screens with witty, professional text to guide users through their financial journey.
2. Visual Fluidity: Added entrance animations to Onboarding, Login, and Registration screens for a "premium" feel.
3. Functional Reliability: Fixed email update logic in AuthProvider to ensure profile changes persist correctly across local and remote storage.
4. Optimized AI: Switched the default SMS parsing engine to Groq for faster, cost-effective transaction detection.

High-level Workflow
1. User starts the app (Auth/Onboarding) -> Experiences smooth slide-in animations.
2. User navigates through screens -> Clear, friendly instructions and status labels.
3. User updates profile -> Changes are saved reliably to SQLite and SharedPreferences.

Business Value
- Higher user retention through better "First Time User Experience" (FTUE).
- Reduced friction in user management.
- Significant brand differentiation via unique copy style.

Risks
- Subjective tone might not resonate with all users.
- Groq free tier rate limits (mitigated by key rotation and batching).

Cost Implications
- Reduced token costs by prioritizing Groq over higher-priced providers.
