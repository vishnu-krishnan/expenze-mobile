Expenze - Technical Specification: UI Cleanliness Refinement

System Overview
This refinement targets the presentation layer of the Expenze mobile application, specifically the AppBar and SliverAppBar configurations across all screens.

Component Breakdown
Navigation System
- Modification: Disabled automated and manual back button rendering. Standardized global heading alignment to the left.
- Affected Widgets: Scaffold, AppBar, SliverAppBar, CustomScrollView, FlexibleSpaceBar.
- Implementation:
  - automaticallyImplyLeading: false
  - Removal of leading icons.
  - Set centerTitle: false in all AppBar and SliverAppBar instances.
  - Standardized titleSpacing to ensure consistent left-padding across screens (e.g., 26px for standard AppBars).

Recurring Payments Screen
- Modification: Refactored the header to unify the heading.
- Affected Files: lib/presentation/screens/regular/regular_payments_screen.dart.
- Implementation: Removed "Auto-pay Bills" text and changed the primary heading to "Recurring Payments".

Settings Configuration
- Modification: Removal of the Reset Application functionality.
- Affected Files: lib/presentation/screens/settings/settings_screen.dart.
- Logic: Removed the TextButton trigger and its associated _showResetPrompt dialog logic.

Data Flow
No changes to data flow. The navigation stack remains intact; only visual triggers for popping the stack are removed. 

Security Model
- Increased security by removing the "Reset Application" button, which could be used to clear local security settings (PIN/Biometrics).

Performance Analysis
- Negligible improvement due to fewer widgets rendered.

Technical Impact
- UX: Reliance on OS-level gestures for "back" navigation.

Deployment Plan
- Part of UI Refinement Phase.
- Class: Minor Change.

Rollback Plan
- Revert automaticallyImplyLeading and restore leading icon implementations.
- Re-add the _showResetPrompt method and its button.
- Revert centerTitle to true where applicable.
