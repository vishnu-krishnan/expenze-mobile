Business Overview - Firebase Authentication Integration
________________________________________________________________________________

Problem
The previous authentication system was entirely local, which lacked professional security standards such as managed session persistence, password complexity enforcement, and the ability to eventually synchronize data across multiple devices.

Objective
Implement a production-grade, industry-standard identity management system using Firebase Authentication to secure user accounts while maintaining the application's unique "offline-first" financial data architecture.

Feature Summary
- Universal Identity: Seamless authentication using Email/Password or Google Sign-In.
- Secure Sessions: Managed login sessions that persist across app restarts and device updates.
- Hybrid Data Model: User identity is verified by the cloud (Firebase), while sensitive financial transactions remain private and local (SQLite).
- User Branding: Automatic fetching of profile pictures and full names from verified Google accounts.

High-level Workflow
1. User chooses an authentication method (Email or Google).
2. Firebase verifies the credentials securely.
3. The application receives a verified User ID.
4. The system automatically creates or updates a local "Identity Wallet" in the SQLite database to link financial records.
5. User gains access to their dashboard with all local data intact.

Business Value
- Trust: Users feel safer using a tool backed by Google's security infrastructure.
- Engagement: Google Sign-In provides a "one-tap" onboarding experience, reducing user drop-off.
- Scale: The architecture is now ready for future features like Cloud Backup or cross-device synchronization.

Risks
- Dependency: Requires internet access for the initial login/registration.
- Mitigation: Once logged in, the app remains fully functional offline thanks to the persistent local database.

Cost Implications
- Free Tier: This implementation falls entirely within the Firebase "Spark" free tier for current and projected user growth.

Timeline
- Setup: Completed
- Integration: Completed
- Verification: Completed
