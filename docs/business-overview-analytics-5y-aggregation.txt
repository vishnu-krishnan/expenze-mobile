Business Overview - Analytics 5-Year Aggregation

Problem
The 5-year analytics view was cluttered and difficult to interpret because it attempted to plot 60 individual monthly data points on a single chart. This resulted in a "crowded" line with overlapping dots, making it nearly impossible for users to identify long-term trends at a glance.

Objective
To simplify long-term analysis by aggregating monthly data into yearly summaries when the 5-year period is selected.

Feature Summary
- Yearly Aggregation: For the 5-year view, the application now automatically groups 60 months of data into 5 distinct yearly points.
- Improved Chart Clarity: The line chart now shows clear yearly peaks and troughs, removing the visual noise of monthly fluctuations.
- Consistent UI: The list view and chart labels dynamically switch from "Monthly" to "Yearly" when the 5-year window is active.
- Optimized Formatting: Date labels reflect the aggregation level (showing just the year, e.g., "2024" instead of "Jan 24") for better readability.

Business Value
- Strategic Insights: Users can now see their annual spending growth or reduction over a half-decade period.
- Professional Aesthetics: The chart remains clean and premium regardless of the data volume.
- Ease of Use: Automatic switching between monthly and yearly views provides the right level of detail at the right time.

Timeline
- Implementation and Verification: 20 minutes.
