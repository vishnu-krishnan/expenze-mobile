Expenze - UI Cleanliness Refinement

Problem
The application UI contained standard "back" buttons and system reset controls that cluttered the premium visual experience. The user desired a "cleaner" aesthetic where navigation is more intuitive or driven by the global layout, and destructive system actions are restricted.

Objective
Remove all explicit back buttons and the system reset action to achieve a minimalist, premium look and feel across the mobile application.

Feature Summary
- Navigation Cleanup: Removed back buttons from all screens, including Analytics, Categories, Profile, Settings, and Onboarding.
- Safety Restriction: Removed the "Reset Application" button from the Settings screen to prevent accidental data loss and simplify the configuration interface.
- Heading Alignment: Unified all application headings to be left-aligned for a modern, consistent aesthetic.
- Screen Refactoring: Updated the "Recurring Payments" screen to use a cleaner, single-heading layout by removing the "Auto-pay Bills" subtitle.

High-level Workflow
1. Identify all AppBar and SliverAppBar instances in the presentation layer.
2. Set automaticallyImplyLeading: false and remove explicit leading properties.
3. Set centerTitle: false across all app bars.
4. Locate the "Reset Application" control in the Settings screen and remove it.
5. Verify that the UI remains functional while appearing significantly cleaner.

Business Value
- Premium Brand Identity: Aligns the UI with modern "lean" design standards prevalent in high-end financial applications.
- Simplified Experience: A simpler UI reduces cognitive load for the user.
- Improved Retention: A wowed user is more likely to continue using the app.

Risks
- Navigation Deadlocks: Users might find it difficult to navigate back if they are not familiar with gestures or alternative navigation paths.

Cost Implications
- Minimal navigation design work.
